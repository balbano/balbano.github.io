title: Blogroll
---

In my continued effort to unearth the traditions of the internet of yore, I present to you: my blogroll! This is a mix of stuff that I actively read and stuff that I'm intending to read and stuff that I read a really good post on one time, added to this list, and then forgot about. These are mostly, but not entirely, about TTRPGS.

This list could always be longer! Email me something you think I'd like about games, clown, or pumping iron! [brendan@brendanalbano.com](mailto:brendan@brendanalbano.com)
