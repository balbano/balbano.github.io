        <p>“Let’s start with the end of the world, why don’t we? Get it over with and move on to more interesting things.”</p>
<p>BANG! POW! Dang. That’s how you start a novel. My goodness. MMM.</p>
<p><em>The Broken Earth Trilogy</em> (<em>The Fifth Season</em>, <em>The Obelisk Gate</em>, <em>The Stone Sky</em>) by N.K. Jemisin is rich, dark, brutal and hopeful. You should read it right now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It’s tempting to say Jemisin takes the tropes and structures of science fiction and fantasy and subverts them, but I think that isn’t quite the right way of saying it. Not quite the right atmosphere. It felt more like Jemisin took the tropes of sci-fi/fantasy that I’ve grown up with and filled them to bursting with a nuance, depth and immediacy I had barely realized I was missing.</p>
<p>Of course, I grew up reading stories about people who looked like me. Expressed their gender like me. I grew up with fantasy heroes from worlds built on the foundation of an idealized, glossy, magical version of medieval Europe that mirrored the glossy version of history I was taught in grade school. If you grew up reading sci-fi/fantasy and the heroes weren’t so clearly modelled on your identity and your history, all those things I barely realized were missing were probably glaringly, painfully obvious to you.</p>
<p><em>Broken Earth</em> tackles what feels like the two most pressing issues facing the world today: racism and environmental catastrophe. And Jemisin does it brilliantly. Jemisin is the first person to win the Hugo award three years in a row and the first person to win it for all three books in a trilogy. Despite all these accolades, I picked up <em>The Fifth Season</em> in Powell’s and put it down what must have been a dozen times. I think I was a little intimidated by how serious it sounded, and I would walk out the door with something lighter. I’m so glad to have finally read it. Jemisin asks what it means to be human, what it means to be a part of a community, what it means to love, and what it means to attempt the impossible. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time.</p>
