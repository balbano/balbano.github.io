        <p>Today’s mood: “Crazy Over You” - BLACKPINK</p>
<p>Somehow, sometime, I think I stopped reading novels. Not completely, but mostly. When I was a kid, reading was pretty much all I did.</p>
<p>After singing its praises for what felt like months, Kate finally broke through and I picked up <em>Gideon the Ninth</em> by Tamsyn Muir. I read it straight through and didn’t get to bed until 4AM. Which definitely hits a bit harder than it used to. Demonstrating an absolutely astounding amount of self-control I spaced the sequal, <em>Harrow the Ninth</em>, out over two days. It was a delight. <em>Gideon</em> is achingly romantic, exquisitely crafted, and set in a world somewhere between Gormenghast and Warhammer 40,000. Obviously I loved it.</p>

<p>My complete disinterest in pacing myself when it comes to fantasy has stopped me from reading, and that’s a real shame. I have even tried reading boring books (Sorry, Tolkein, but the first place I turned was <em>The Silmarillion</em>) so that I wouldn’t stay up all night. Which basically worked… but then I got bored, didn’t finish it, and didn’t pick up another book for quite a while. <em>Titus Groan</em> by Mervyn Peak hit a perfect mark of slow enough that I didn’t stay up <em>all</em> night, but engrossing enough that I made it to the end. But searching for books that were boring but not too boring wasn’t something that I could really get excited about. And I didn’t read much.</p>
<p>I love reading.</p>
<p>I love it so much.</p>
<p><em>Gideon</em> reminded me of that. It’s time to accept that I prefer to read to excess. To overwhelm myself. To stuff myself.</p>
<p>To novels! And to staying up past your bedtime reading them!</p>
<p>Also, trying out this blog thing again :)</p>
