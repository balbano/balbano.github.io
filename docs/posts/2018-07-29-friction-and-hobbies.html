        <p>Friction in a retail shopping experience is all the things that get in the way of a customer walking in, picking up the thing they want, and walking out (with the money being automatically deducted from their bank account via brain chip, or whatever). I don’t remember where I came across this concept, and I’m not particularly interested in the nuances of how much friction one (who?) wants in a retail experience, but I did think the idea of friction was pretty cool.</p>
<p>I have a lot of hobbies (this is all going to tie together, just hold on a second).</p>
<p>I have a lot of hobbies that I don’t do very often. I make a piece of ultralight backpacking gear every 3 or 4 months. I carved a handful of spoons a year ago, and haven’t since. I wrote a lot of words during <a href="https://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> one time when I was a teenager. And then again last year. So that’s something like a 15 year gap between my two forrays into writing fiction.</p>
<p>Anyways, the point is, I love doing all these things. They fill me with satisfaction. But the vast majority of the time, the sewing machine is tucked underneath a table. The carving knives are deep in a tool bag. My thoughts about novelling are “maybe next November”. And instead of doing these creative things that bring my a lot of joy, I refresh reddit or scroll through instagram or do any number of mindless, mildly entertaining, but ultimately unsatisfying activities.</p>
<p>I have a lot of trouble starting projects. Also finishing projects.</p>
<p>At some point, I started to notice that instead of trying to just sit down and do the thing, I had better luck if all I did was get set up. Then the following day, with everything already retrieved from the tool bags and layed out nicely, I found it much easier to tackle actually starting the project.</p>
<p>Just getting set up was more likely to feel approachable. And the following day, once I was all set up, getting started was more approachable too. I was reducing friction. And I was learning that I often have a very low capacity to overcome friction to start projects. Such a low capacity that the fairly small amount of friction of unpacking the sewing machine and getting it set up (for example) was enough to stop me from doing any sewing.</p>
<p>So I decided to do an experiment where I picked one hobby (sewing in this case), and cleared off a corner of the desk in my partner and my apartment to have the sewing machine stay set up on for a little while.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a particular project in mind. But I did have a long list of projects that I’d been wanting to get to for months that I hadn’t started. Some of them were tiny, but still, they lingered, undone.</p>
<p>Yesterday I felt motivated to modify our <a href="http://www.rayjardine.com/ray-way/Tarp-Kit/index.htm">Ray-Way Tarp</a> so that our <a href="https://seatosummitusa.com/collections/mobile-outdoor/products/nano-mosquito-pyramid-net-with-insect-shield?variant=7896098963484">S2S Nano Mosquito Pyramid</a> would hang better and wouldn’t require the 1oz spreader bar it comes with. And I waffled. But the sewing machine was already set up. And plugged in. And the bobbin was threaded. And I dove in, and it took maybe 20 minutes at the most and it was done!</p>
<p>Once we test the new setup out I’ll write up a review with lots of pictures.</p>
<p>Until then, I’m pretty pleased with this low-friction sewing project, and the sewing machine is going to continue taking up a sizeable portion of our tiny apartment, and hopefully I’ll be doing a lot more sewing!</p>
