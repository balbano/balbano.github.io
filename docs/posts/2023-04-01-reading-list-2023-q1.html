        <p>I had so much fun with my reading goal last year, I’m running it back. Rather than wait until the end, I figured I’d do periodic updates along the way. I’m being as flexible as I feel inclined to be any given month about what counts as a book. Below are the books I read in the first three months of 2023.</p>
<p>(Link to last year’s <a href="2023-01-02-2022-reading-list.html">reading goal</a> post because my blog template gets weird if I put a link in the first paragraph and I haven’t gotten around to fixing it).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em> by Ted Chiang</li>
<li><em>Legends and Lattes</em> by Travis Baldree</li>
<li><em>The Raven Tower</em> by Ann Leckie</li>
<li><em>When the Tiger Came Down the Mountain</em> by Nghi Vo</li>
<li><em>Binti</em> by Nnedi Okorafor</li>
<li><em>Binti: Home</em> by Nnedi Okorafor</li>
<li><em>Binti: The Night Masquerade</em> by Nnedi Okorafor</li>
<li><em>Into the Riverlands</em> by Nghi Vo</li>
<li><em>Starstruck</em> by Elaine Lee and Michael Kaluta</li>
<li><em>Blades in the Dark</em> by John Harper</li>
<li><em>Mork Bork</em> by Pelle Nilsson and Johan Nohr</li>
<li><em>Four Thousand Weeks</em> by Oliver Burkeman</li>
<li><em>Saga Vol. 1</em> by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples</li>
<li><em>Starstruck: Old Proldiers Never Die</em> by Elaine Lee and Michael Kaluta</li>
<li><em>Banana</em> by Dan Koeppel</li>
<li><em>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</em> by N. K. Jemisin</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided I wanted to read more comics this year, and kicking things off with <em>Starstruck</em> was a delight. It was a little hard to follow at times, but once I got my sea legs (space legs?), I was in love. The universe of <em>Starstruck</em> is equal parts whimsical and cynical in a truly joyous way. The comics are available online at <a href="https://starstruckcomics.com/">https://starstruckcomics.com/</a>, but I thought reading it on paper was well worth it.</p>
<p>If you’re into the particularly nerdy depths that is RPG actual plays, I got turned onto <em>Starstruck</em> by the <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/dimension-20/season:13">Dimension 20 Actual Play</a>. Speaking of actual plays, I am adoring <a href="https://worldsbeyondnumber.com/">Worlds Beyond Number</a>. The Children’s Campaign available on the Worlds Beyond Number Patreon is well worth it.</p>
