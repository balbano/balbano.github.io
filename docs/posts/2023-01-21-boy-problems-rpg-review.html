        <p>I’ve played Dungeons &amp; Dragons on and off since I was a kid. I’ve played some other role-playing games here and there as well, but D&amp;D has always occupied the lion’s share of RPGs I’ve played. The on and off was mostly on when I was a kid. And mostly off for the next 10-15 years. Lately I’ve been getting back into the hobby, which has been a delight. One of the things I’ve been enjoying is branching out and trying other RPGs.</p>
<p>Lasers and Feelings is a one-page rpg for playing a game in the genre of Star Trek. <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf">Give it a quick read. It’s only one page!</a> The rest of my thoughts will make more sense if you’ve familiarized yourself with Lasers and Feelings. I’m also assuming you’ve played D&amp;D before!</p>
<p><a href="https://boyproblems.ca/boyproblems">Boy Problems</a> uses the same basic rules as Lasers and Feelings, but trades Star Trek for cyberpunk + Carly Rae Jepson.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I GMed a session of Boy Problems and it was exciting to play a game that was so different than D&amp;D. I ran the scenario that comes with boy problems, which is a heist taking place during a gala at MoMA NY in the near future.</p>
<p>A few things that stuck with me after the game:</p>
<p>The speedy resolution mechanic made it really easy to split the party and have a hacker character trying to get into the IT room, while another character got hired to cater the gala, and another snuck in as a performer. Cutting back and forth between the action allowed a cinematic feel that felt like a heist movie. I’ve never felt comfortable splitting the party in 3 or 4 different places like that in a D&amp;D type system. Not that it can’t be done in D&amp;D, but it felt like this system really supported it, and that felt really appropriate for the genre.</p>
<p>The second thing was that using the same resolution mechanic for everything made it easy to expand and contract time. Sometimes you could make a single role to determine if you seduced the security guard (and then fade to black, first time using safety tools as well and a “pause, fast forward” was executed excellently in that moment). Other times when two people are diving for a fumbled taser during a fight you could make a roll for each leap, each grab, each time the taser gets fumbled and you need to decide where it bounces. It felt like I could drop into slow motion, which was really fun!</p>
<p>The last thing I noticed, was that it was exhausting. I realized that as a GM, D&amp;D type combat allows me to take a breather from improv storytelling. Without a crunchy combat subsystem, it was all improv all the time!</p>
<p>There are a lot of things I enjoy about D&amp;D and similar games, but playing a game that took a very different approach has enhanced my RPG experience tremendously. If you’re an RPG player that mostly only plays one game system, whether it’s D&amp;D or something else, try taking a detour into something completely different every now and then!</p>
