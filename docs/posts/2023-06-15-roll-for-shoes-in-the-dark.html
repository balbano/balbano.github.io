        <p>Worlds Beyond Number is doing a 2-shot using the RPG Roll for Shoes which sounds like a really charming rules-light system. I’ve been having a lot of fun with extremely minimal RPGs like Lasers and Feelings and Electric Bastionland recently, and Roll for Shoes sounds right up my alley.</p>
<p>I’ve also been wanting to dip my toes in doing a little RPG design by hacking one of these rules light systems. So here is a simple idea for a Roll for Shoes hack:</p>
<h2 id="roll-for-shoes-in-the-dark">Roll for Shoes in the Dark</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use step 1 of <a href="https://rollforshoes.com/">Roll for Shoes</a> to assemble your dice pool</li>
<li>In step 2, resolve the dice pool per <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/core-system">Blades in the Dark</a>’s dice pool resolution system: roll the dice, read the single highest die, 6 is a full success, 4-5 is partial success or success with complication, 1-3 is failure.</li>
<li>All other rules per Roll for Shoes</li>
</ul>
<p>My thinking is two-fold. First, partial successes are fun. Second, because it doesn’t require doing any arithmetic, and doesn’t require the GM to set a difficulty for the opposed roll, it gets you right back to the action. Does Roll for Shoes benefit from these changes? No idea! I need to actually try playing this to find out. But it sounds fun on paper!</p>
<p>Edit: apparently I am not the first person to come up with this idea! I guess that shouldn’t be too surprising. Here is someone who beat me to it: <a href="https://boocherry.itch.io/shoes-in-the-dark">https://boocherry.itch.io/shoes-in-the-dark</a>.</p>
