        <p>This is part 2 of <strong>More Than Telling a Story</strong>, an open-ended series of posts describing aspects of TTRPGs that resonate with me that aren’t “telling a story.”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../posts/2025-10-04-more-than-telling-a-story-part-1-describing.html">Part 1: Describing</a></li>
<li>Part 2: Being Clever (this post right here!)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also maybe the first time in my life I’ve actually written the “part 2” of a series, so that’s exciting!</p>
<h2 id="being-clever">Being Clever</h2>
<h3 id="clever-solutions-to-problems-without-solutions">Clever solutions to problems without solutions</h3>
<p>A common mode of play in OSR-style games is when the GM describes an obstacle to the players, and does not have any particular solution in mind (or is at least open to being surprised), then the players proceed to ask questions about their environment, look at the list of bizarre shit they’ve accumulated in their inventories, and then pitch the GM a solution combining various objects and elements of their fictional environment. The GM then becomes an adjudicator of cleverness.</p>
<p>If the GM deems the solution clever enough, it just works! If it’s not quite convincing, or if it involves an element of chance, you might have to make a roll or a saving throw. And of course, if it’s not clever enough, if it doesn’t seem plausible, it just plain might not work.</p>
<p>This back and forth between players and GM negotiating the problem-without-a-solution is an example of playing with cleverness.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-solutions">Problems with solutions</h3>
<p>The problems without solutions style of play is itself a sort of solution to the stumbles that are easy to make when playing TTRPGS with more structured puzzles. It can be frustrating to feel stonewalled by a puzzle with a solution that you just can’t find. Feeling like you’re not clever enough isn’t all that fun! But in spite of the risks, I’ve recently become curious about this more traditional puzzle solving where you <em>do</em> have solutions. I’m looking forward to running some escape-room-style puzzle dungeons, and reading <a href="https://puzzledungeon.com/">Direct Sun’s puzzle dungeon posts</a>. Done well, this is another exciting way to play towards the joy of being clever.</p>
<h3 id="word-play">Word play</h3>
<p>In some games, trying to bend your skills, tags, etc., to always apply to the challenge at hand can feel against the spirit of the game, but when it fits the tone, or isn’t overdone, it can be a lot of fun!</p>
<p>In my game <a href="https://ponypress.itch.io/word-wizards">Word Wizards</a>, the central mechanic revolves around knowing a very limited number of words of power, and then bending them to solve any problem your character faces. I remember during a playtest, one character had the word of power “cow” and, faced with a terrifying situation, declared “I’m no COWard” to use their magic to give them bravery. That’s exactly the sort of “being clever” that is the core gameplay of Word Wizards, and is another version of the play of cleverness.</p>
<h3 id="making-your-friends-laugh">Making your friends laugh</h3>
<p>When the player proclaimed “I’m no COWard” I laughed! This might get a whole post of it’s own, but there is another form of cleverness at play in making your friends laugh.</p>
<p>Another example: I was playing a game at a con with a game designer who had been mostly playing larps. We were playing TEETH, which is not a larp, and is a game that leaves room for humor. At one point they made a 4th-wall-breaking joke, which I recall getting a laugh, and I now totally forget what the joke was. But what I remember is that after the game they said that they had forgotten how fun it can be to just make a dumb joke and get a laugh. That’s also the play of cleverness. Just like not every game is about telling stories with your friends, not every game is about telling jokes with your friends, but some games are, and that can be a very satisfying type of play!</p>
<h3 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h3>
<p>There is a joy in being clever with or for your fellow players, but there is also a joy in being clever when you are your own audience.</p>
<p>Participating in game jams sometimes also feels like this form of play.</p>
<p>There are lots more ways to enjoy being clever in TTRPGs, and I wanna do the engagement thing where I ask you to share other places you find the joy of being clever in TTRPGs… but I’m still on this “no comments” thing, so go find my email in the about page and email me or something &lt;3.</p>
