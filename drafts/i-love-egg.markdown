Found [Egg](https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/egg) from [4 great games you can finish in one sitting](https://www.mothership.blog/4-great-games-you-can-finish-in-one-sitting/) on [mothership.blog](mothership.blog). I did not finish it in one sitting (more on that in a second), but I did fall in love with it!

I thought it was interesting that I didn't finish Egg in one sitting, despite Zoë Hannah writing on Mothership that "you can crush in a few hours." I was having a fantastic time, but my attention wandered, despite the fact that I was playing a video game! I had read Cal Newport's newsletter [Film Students Can No Longer Sit Through Films](https://calnewport.com/film-students-can-no-longer-sit-through-films/) a few days ago, and I think can easily apply to all sorts of entertainment.

Two minutes into playing Egg I felt the pull of "I need to hop on Discord and say something cute about how Egg is my new favorite souls-like". I decided I would try to finish the game before telling anyone (other than my spouse) about it. I did immediately shout "come feel how good the egg jumps!" but that felt very important.
