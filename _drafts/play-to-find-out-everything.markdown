title: "Play to Find Out Everything"
categories: games
---

What if we "played to find out" everything about our characters? We start with a completely blank character sheet. We know nothing about the character's past. We know nothing about the character's abilities. Each character begins as a featureless lump of clay, whether a young person who doesn't yet know who they are or an android freshly emerged from a vat with no memories of their own, and through play they become unique individuals. Both the character and the player are finding out who the character is together.

Part of my impulse to explore this is that I don't love writing backstory. But also, without backstory, without laying out relationships in advance, it is easy to fall into a mode of play where the characters feel like they lack a clear reason why they are doing whatever it is they are doing, and also lack a clear reason why they are doing it together with these particular people. And I don't particularly love this either. 

I want all the benefits that developing backstory and relationships in a session 0 offers, but instead of in session 0, I want to slowly create these connections over sessions 1, 2, 3, and beyond, and I want them to be directly rooted in the events of each game session.

This train of thought, combined with the previous post about playing without stats or hit points, has been the main drive for the game I'm currently working on, working title: *Everything You Are Must Be Found.* And similar to the last post, I'm not trying to present this as a better or correct way to play, but am excited to explore what happens if I play this way. As an experiment in taking an idea ("play to find out") to a really extreme place.

Major inspirations have been two lovely books about robots: *The Murderbot Diaries* by Martha Wells and *A Closed and Common Orbit* by Martha Wells, and the character-creation-through-play in *The Wizard, The Witch, and the Wild One Children's Campaign* by Worlds Beyond Number.

Here is an early draft of how I've tried to put this idea into the heart of *Everything You Are Must Be Found*.

## Potentials and Experience

A Potential is something that stuck out to your character, and might become a Core in the future (more on Cores in the next section). Your character begins with no Potentials.

At the beginning of each session after the first, have the players recap the previous session. During the recap, each player recounts up to 3 moments in the previous session that inspired a new Potential in your character. Add these Potentials to your character sheet.

Here some examples of things that could be Potentials:

- A value or philosophy: justice, hedonism, might makes right, family
- Bonds: Shad’hadar is my best friend, I am a loyal servant of the empire, Bladez is my rival.
- Drives: I will become the strongest person in the world, I crave wealth, I am always seeking love.
- Identity: I am brave, I am cautious, I am an android and proud of it
- Joy/fascination/obsession: I love soap operas
- Things: This gun is my whole identity

At the end of each session, mark 1 experience on each Potential that your character explored during that session. If your character explored a Potential many times over the session, mark 2 experience.

## Cores and Downtime

Cores are beliefs about yourself and the world around you that define the core of your identity. Cores make you more resilient. Your character can believe any of these things without them necessarily being a core. If it is a core, that means it’s something that contributes to your character’s understanding of who they are. Cores always start out as Potentials. Your character begins with no cores.

After a period of downtime, upgrade your Potential with the most experience to a Core. If you have no Potentials with experience, you add no new cores, but may instead mark 1 experience on a potential if you explored it during downtime.

Cores affect your dice rolls and make you more resilient.

## Playtesting

I'm two sessions into playtesting, and have been running "Gradient Descent" starting with the characters having woken up in cryopods with no memories. "Gradient Descent" is written for *Mothership*, but I'm treating it as a system-agnostic campaign and ignoring the *Mothership* specific bits.
