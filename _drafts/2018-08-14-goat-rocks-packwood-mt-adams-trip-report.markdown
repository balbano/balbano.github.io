First trip report on the new blog! In which Kate and I go on a backpacking trip with a bunch of strangers from the internet and live to tell the tale!

I forget how it all started, but at some point, I was chatting online (seems thematic for this old-school blog idea) with a bunch of folks from the [ultralight subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultralight) and someone said we should all go on a trip together. And then all of a sudden folks were taking time off work and getting flights and coming up with trip ideas. Since a good chunk of us were located in the PNW, a 5 day trip through the Goat Rocks solidified as our plan... until a few days before we were supposed to leave the Miriam Fire started and everything went a little haywire.

Complicating matters was that Scott and Sam were planning to do a route doing a 360 around Mt. Adams that Scott had devised immediately before the 5 day Goat Rocks trip, and they wouldn't have cell service. But due to the uncertainties about smoke from the Miriam Fire, we were planning to call the ranger station and ask about the conditions the day before we left. If conditions looked okay, we'd go ahead with the Goat Rocks trip, and if not, we'd frantically developped a backup plan in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.

To solve the communication problem, it was decided that Monday morning (the day before our Tuesday-Saturday trip) Kate and I would call the ranger station, get whatever info we could, make a decision with the rest of the crew still in cellphone range, then drive to Walupt Lake, where we would meet up with Scott and Sam and let them know which trip we were doing, and if necessary, shuttle them back to their car so we could all drive to Alpine Lakes.

# Day 0: Driving to Walupt Lake

We called the ranger station first thing on Monday and the ranger said that they hadn't gotten any reports about the Miriam Fire smoke yet, but thought the wind would be in our favor and didn't try to disuade us from our planned itinerary. They also told us that a washout on Coyote Trail 79 that we were worried about had just been repaired. We decided to go ahead with our Goat Rocks trip with the knowledge that we might have to adapt our itinerary if the smoke ended up being bad. I also was a little suspicious that I wasn't in good enough shape to handle our planned itinerary, but I figured, like the fire, I'd just have to adapt when the issue came up!

We had taken the bus down to Eugene the previous day to borrow my parents' car and driven it back to Portland, so after we confirmed our itinerary with the rest of the crew, we headed out to find Scott and Sam at Walupt Lake.

We had all day to make our way there, so we took the scenic route via Highway 14 on the north side of the gorge and then headed north through Trout Lake.

When we stopped at the burger joint/coffee shop/gas station in Trout Lake, the place was swarming with PCT thruhikers, and I quickly spotted someone I followed on instagram which was a trip! After finishing our burgers, I asked the folks I recognized from instagram if they needed a ride and they did! And a short one at that! And it turns out the place Kate and I are moving in September isn't too far from where some of them live in Portland! Making new friends already!

This was the first of many firsts on this trip for me, and I was quite tickled to give a ride to a crew of PCT hikers. Our trip is done now, but they're still hiking and you can follow along at [Homework's blog](http://www.soletosoil.com). My cameo is in the day 5 entry posted August 7th. I'm basically famous now as far as I can tell.

The rest of the drive was pretty low-key, and we found Sam and Scott sprawled out on the side of the road about a mile from Walupt Lake and gave them a ride the rest of the way. We got a car camping spot at the lake and set up our shelters and fed them snacks and beer as they recovered from their Adams 360 adventure.

# Day 1: Big climb to Goat Lake

On Tuesday morning, the rest of our crew started rolling in, and soon the 9 of us were gathered at the trailhead ready to tackle a big climb up Nannie Ridge Trail 98. 1900 ft of elevation gain over 2.4 miles got us all sweating right off the bat. 

# Day 2: The adventure begins

# Day 3: Hitchin', wheelin', and car campin'

# Day 4: Mt. Adams High Camp

# Day 5: Heading home
