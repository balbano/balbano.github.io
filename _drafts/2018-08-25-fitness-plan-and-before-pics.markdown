title: Fitness Plan and Before Pics

In my previous post I mentioned I was embarking on a new fitness plan, so here's the deets. The goal is to stop injuring myself whenever I start getting into hiking or running, which has happened a number of times over a number of years now. Most recently, my knee started hurting on my recent trip to Goat Rocks.

I think one of the big culprits is my desk job. And one of the main effects of the desk job is weak glutes. So after some quality time with google, I've come up with a gameplan:

# Before work: Simple and Sinister

I've found that I have a better track record with short workouts I can do every day, rather than long workouts a few times a week. I also seem to do a little better with at-home workouts.

# Throughout the day: Glute Kegels

I encountered these in a [blog post about a hiker fixing their knee up before a successful PCT thruhike](https://medium.com/@OVCM/how-i-fixed-my-knee-injury-in-time-to-hike-2-450-miles-this-summer-61fe599205e3) and they sound great.

# After work: Yoga with Adrienne

Kate and I have been doing Yoga with Adrienne on youtube and it's been really great. Her instruction style seems to be just right for us at the moment, and we've managed to stick to it for several months now, only missing a few days, so in an effort to not fix what ain't broke, I'm still on the Yoga with Adrienne every day train!
