Lasers and Feelings is a one-page rpg for playing a game in the genre of Star Trek. Worth a quick read if you haven’t read it before (only 1 page!) http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf

Boy Problems uses the same rules, but applies a cyberpunk theme + Carly Rae Jepson flavor (yes, it’s weird lol) instead of the Star Trek flavor. https://boyproblems.ca/boyproblems

I ran the scenario that comes with boy problems, which is a heist taking place during a gala at MoMA NY in the near future.

Two things that immediately struck me:

The really speedy resolution mechanic made it really easy to split the party and have a hacker character trying to get into the IT room, while another character got hired to cater the gala, and another snuck in as a performer.  Cutting back and forth between the action allowed a cinematic feel that really felt like a heist movie. I’ve never felt comfortable splitting the party in 3 or 4 different places like that in a d&d type system. Not that it can’t be done, but just that it felt like this system really supported it, and that felt really appropriate for the genre.

The second thing that was really exciting was that using the same resolution mechanic for everything made it really easy to expand and contract time. Sometimes you could make a single role to determine if you seduced the security guard (and then fade to black, first time using safety tools as well and a “pause, fast forward” was executed excellently in that moment). Other times when two people are diving for a fumbled taser during a fight you could make a roll for each leap, each grab, each time the taser gets fumbled and you need to decide where it bounces. It felt like I could drop into slow motion, which was really fun!

The last thing I noticed, was that it was exhausting. I realized that as a GM, d&d type combat allows me to take a breather from improv storytelling. Without a crunchy combat subsystem, it was all improv all the time!
