The Salty Runback from Plasmodics

In Plasmodics, a Gamma World "demake" by Will Jobst, everyone has 10 Hit Points. When your HP hits zero, things get exciting. You make a choice: are you incapacitated, hoping an ally can drag you to safety? Or are you bold enough for a Salty Runback? The Salty Runback looks Death in the eyes and says "double or nothing." Time stops. Both you and the adversary that brought you to zero HP are restored to full health, and you duke it out one-on-one. If you win, you level up. If you lose, you're dead. I love this.

Within the murky waters OSR-style play, deadly combat is a common feature. The Salty Runback tosses in a leaky barrel of neon-green toxic sludge that offers players an exciting moment of narrative control, a risk-reward decision, and a cinematic spotlight.

The decision to be incapacitated or to give your foe a Salty Runback can be a narrative one. Does it feel right to be knocked down and let your allies try to bail you out? To retreat and regroup? Or is this the moment to put death on the line? A heroic last stand or an ego-fueled shout of "I'd rather die than lose!" While this decision lets you put your thumb on the scale, it doesn't guarantee a particular outcome, and the dice always have an opportunity to shape the emergent narrative.

The decision can also be a game-y one. The Salty Runback is the only way to level up. Do you think you can win? Do you feel lucky? Notably, leveling up in Plasmodics broadens your characters capabilities, but doesn't straightforwardly increase their power in a way that will leave other characters feeling like they are useless until they catch up. You don't have to ever level up to play the game. This makes it a real choice. But you know you want to.

In addition to its narrative and mechanical impacts, the Salty Runback changes the cinematic texture of combat by passing the spotlight to one character for the duration of their dramatic duel. Suddenly the other players are spectators, gasping and cheering as the dice are rolled, able to fully focus on the one-on-one battle until it reaches its deadly conclusion. Even in a fast-and-deadly combat system, like the Into-the-Odd-based combat in Plasmodics, it can take a lot of creative effort from the GM and players to keep combat exciting. The Salty Runback gives combat an injection of mutant hyper-adrenaline just when player engagement might be starting to flag. And if your engagement is starting to flag: go read the Living and Dying page in Plasmodics! It's about 1/3 the length of this essay, and it'll rev you right back up.
