# Every Knight's Story Begins

**Every knight's story begins the same way:** a splitting headache, a pool of vomit, a dying fire, and no memory of who they are or how they got there.

The knight's only memory is a dreamlike ritual where they spoke the following words as they tossed their possessions into a roaring fire:

> I burn my boots to call a mighty steed  
> I burn my clothes to earn my armaments  
> I burn my past to claim the title knight

The knight's dream goes black. They hear hoof beats, the sounding of horns, the clash of steel.

The knight awakes. They are cold. They are lying in something wet. Vomit. The embers of a fire fade beside them. They are naked. They remember only the dream, and nothing more. They do not even remember their own name.

They are a knight.

After the last ember winks out, releasing a final gasp of smoke, a breathy groan is heard as pale fingers emerge from the marshy ground where the fire once burned. The creature that claws its way from the earth has long fingers and translucent skin. If the knight is still at the site of the fire, the creature rushes them, wrapping its strong, cold arms around the knight in a crushing embrace. If the knight has left, the creature stalks them.

It is shaped of the memories that didn't burn. 

It wants to give them back to the knight.

Every round the knight is held in the creatures embrace, they regain a memory.

The creature slowly heals from conventional wounds, even when it seems dead. The knight will have to be clever, or exceptional brutal, to find a permanent solution to the memories that stalk them.

## How To Use This Text

This system-agnostic RPG supplement can be a bit of lore to give color to an NPC knight, a character's backstory, or how I'm using it: as the opening scene of a game where all the players are knights and wake up into this predicament together. With multiple knights, the creature is an amalgam of all of their memories, and no guarantee that returned memories end up in the mind of the knight that they came from.

If the creature embraces a character, depending on the game system, and the tone of your game, you can give them a saving throw (or equivalent) to resist regaining a memory.

If a character regains a memory, roll a d6 to prompt the player to invent the memory they regain:

1. A memory of a triumph they were unwilling to forget
2. A memory of a failure they were unable to forget
3. A memory that sparks fear
4. A memory that sparks desire
5. A memory of selfishness
6. A memory of cowardice

The creature's regeneration ability is presented as a problem without a solution to allow any of the player's creative ideas to have the possibility of working. If you need some inspiration, a few possibilities include hacking it into tiny pieces and burying them, performing a ritual to build a stronger fire that will be able to burn these memories successfully, running away forever, or letting it return all their memories that wouldn't burn, tarnishing their knighthood.
