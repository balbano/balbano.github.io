Hi! I'm Brendan. This is my blog. These are my thoughts. Mostly about art, stories, games and walking, although it's not impossible that the occasional thought about architecture sneaks in from time to time. The current form of this blog is an experiment in a sort of anti-social social media. You can contact me at [brendan@brendanalbano.com](mailto:brendan@brendanalbano.com).
