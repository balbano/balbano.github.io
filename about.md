Hi! I'm Brendan. I'm an architect, artist and game designer in Portland, OR. This is my personal blog, mostly about art, stories, games and walking, although it's not impossible that the occasional thought about architecture sneaks in from time to time. There are no comments on this blog, so shoot me an [email](mailto:brendan@brendanalbano.com) if you want to chat.
