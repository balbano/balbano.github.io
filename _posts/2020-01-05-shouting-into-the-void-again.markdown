Today's mood: [Somnabulate by H.P. Parmley](https://hachep.bandcamp.com/track/somnambulate).

Sometimes we have to try things more than once. In honor of the new decade, or just because I went on a losing streak in the MTGO Vintage Cube and need to take a break, I am reviving this old-school-blog-thing. [More details about it in the first post.]({% post_url 2020-01-05-shouting-into-the-void-again %}) Just like last time, I'm not sure where it's going, but social media hasn't been feeling real great lately, so I'm gonna explore this piece of anti-social media. Not gonna beat myself up about not getting very far with it last time, just gonna use it when it feels like a serves a purpose, and right now, it's feeling purposeful.

Love,

Brendan
