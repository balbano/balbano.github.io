Hello, world!

I've been feeling like social media isn't making me feel real great lately, and I ran across a [blog post by Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/2018/03/25/beyond-deletefacebook-more-thoughts-on-embracing-the-social-internet-over-social-media/) that suggested kicking it old-school and going back to shouting into the void from your own personal website. This really appealed on an emotional level! Getting intellectual about it can be the subject of another post.

Cal Newport references [a more indepth article](https://iasc-culture.org/THR/THR_article_2018_Spring_Jacobs.php) about the subject that seems like it will make some good bedtime reading, but I was fired up enough to dive right in and get my blog set up!

Tech-wise, I wanted my blog to require a bit of nerdery, make me feel like a cool computer programmer, and be free. So I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate the blog, hosting it for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and writing my posts in [Vim](https://www.vim.org). Locally, this is all running on Ubuntu inside the [Linux Subsystem for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Anyways, that's all for now!

Coming soon:

- Ultralight backpacking trip reports and gear reviews
- Pictures of things I've made
- How I really feel about architecture
