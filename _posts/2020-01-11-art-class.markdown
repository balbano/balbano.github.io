Today's mood: *Blood* - Kelsey Lu

I've been trying to figure out how to rekindle the things I loved back when I was making art in Vancouver. Sometimes I reread this review of [Mr. Boat-head's Electrical Dreamship](https://www.straight.com/arts/vancouver-fringe-festival-review-mr-boat-heads-electrical-dream-ship-makes-you-think-about-narrative-conventions) by Colin Thomas and get real nostalgic. This probably isn't a terrible healthy activity. My glasses are probably a little rose-tinted. (Also, actual rose-tinted glasses are great. I should get some.)

Perhaps getting back to the past isn't so complicated as I'd imagined. Kate bought me an art class at [Radius](https://www.radiusstudio.org/) with [Lettie Jane Rennekamp](https://www.lettiejane.com/). The first class was last Wednesday and it felt real good. And all I have to do is show up!

We did blind contour drawings of clothes, plants, each other. We painted over them with watercolors. We looked at each others work and talked about it. We did it several times. It was quiet, but it felt like a return. A return to exactly what, I'm not sure. But I felt engaged in a way that I haven't felt in a long time.

Sometimes it's hard to get started. Taking a class seems like a pretty good start. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes.
