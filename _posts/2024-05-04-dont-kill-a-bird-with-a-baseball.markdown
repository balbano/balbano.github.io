In [Don't Kill a Bird with a Baseball: A Randy Johnson TTRPG](https://rat-bastard-games.itch.io/dont-kill-a-bird-with-a-baseball){:target="_blank"} by Rat Bastard Games, each player plays 6'10" baseball pitcher Randy Johnson on March 24, 2001, 7 hours before he will kill a bird with a baseball (this really happened).

But in the game, you aren't our universe's Randy "the Big Unit" Johnson, you are each another Randy Johnson, from another reality. Some other kind of unit. And you are all, for similar or different reasons, trying to avoid your fate.

It's a 3-page narratively-focused RPG that can be played GM-less, or with a GM ("The Umpire of Fate"). When I played it, I was a player, and we played with a GM. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the premise of the game is its biggest strength. It is both absurd and specific in a way that made it feel easy to dive into playing my somewhat sad and mystical Randy Johnson.

The basic resolution mechanic is that you have three stats, and to alter fate, you need to roll under the relevant stat on 2d6.  This system is simple, works smoothly, and the fact that the three stats are Baseball, Pitching, and Big made me chuckle.

Each time you succeed, you accumulate a resource called Friction, and when you eventually fail a roll, the more Friction you have, the more dire the consequences of your failure. The Friction mechanic was delightful and created a mounting sense of tension after each success. The Friction mechanic was exciting and I haven't played any other games that play with this idea of an ever-increasing cost of failure.

The one piece that I wish the game offered a little more guidance about is how to handle the final moment where you must determine if each Randy Johnson kills a bird with a baseball. The game doesn't give you any direct guidance about how to run the end of the game. We handled it with a simple roll, just like any other. This worked fine, but it felt slightly anti-climactic mechanically. 

I expect I will run this game (or facilitate the gm-less version) at some point, and I think I will try something different for the final moments. Two ideas come to mind for how to run the "do you kill the bird" moment. 

One is to resolve it without rolling dice and give the decision as to if they kill the bird to the player themselves, like narrating an epilogue for their character. Or perhaps giving the decision to the other players on the table to pass judgment on each Johnson's efforts to escape their fate.

The other idea I had was to resolve it with a roll, but instead of using one of your skills, to have to roll under your current Friction score, or twice your Friction score if you want a higher chance of escaping your fate. I lean slightly towards the diceless resolution, but it's hard to know for sure without trying it out.

Overall, I had a blast playing the game, the premise is fantastic, the Friction mechanic is clever, and I'm excited to play it again to see more people come up with more Randy Johnsons and to watch them struggle against destiny.
