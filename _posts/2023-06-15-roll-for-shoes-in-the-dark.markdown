Worlds Beyond Number is doing a 2-shot using the RPG Roll for Shoes which sounds like a really charming rules-light system.  I've been having a lot of fun with extremely minimal RPGs like Lasers and Feelings and Electric Bastionland recently, and Roll for Shoes sounds right up my alley.

I've also been wanting to dip my toes in doing a little RPG design by hacking one of these rules light systems. So here is a simple idea for a Roll for Shoes hack:

# Roll for Shoes in the Dark

- Use step 1 of [Roll for Shoes](https://rollforshoes.com/) to assemble your dice pool
- In step 2, resolve the dice pool per [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/core-system)'s dice pool resolution system: roll the dice, read the single highest die, 6 is a full success, 4-5 is partial success or success with complication, 1-3 is failure.
- All other rules per Roll for Shoes
