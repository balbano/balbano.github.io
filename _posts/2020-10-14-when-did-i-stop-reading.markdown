Today's mood: "Crazy Over You" - BLACKPINK

Somehow, sometime, I think I stopped reading novels. Not completely, but mostly. When I was a kid, reading was pretty much all I did.

After singing its praises for what felt like months, Kate finally broke through and I picked up *Gideon the Ninth* by Tamsyn Muir. I read it straight through and didn't get to bed until 4AM. Which definitely hits a bit harder than it used to. Demonstrating an absolutely astounding amount of self-control I spaced the sequal, *Harrow the Ninth*, out over two days. It was a delight. *Gideon* is achingly romantic, exquisitely crafted, and set in a world somewhere between Gormenghast and Warhammer 40,000. Obviously I loved it.

My complete disinterest in pacing myself when it comes to fantasy has stopped me from reading, and that's a real shame. I have even tried reading boring books (Sorry, Tolkein, but the first place I turned was *The Silmarillion*) so that I wouldn't stay up all night. Which basically worked... but then I got bored, didn't finish it, and didn't pick up another book for quite a while. *Titus Groan* by Mervyn Peak hit a perfect mark of slow enough that I didn't stay up *all* night, but engrossing enough that I made it to the end. But searching for books that were boring but not too boring wasn't something that I could really get excited about. And I didn't read much.

I love reading.

I love it so much.

*Gideon* reminded me of that. It's time to accept that I prefer to read to excess. To overwhelm myself. To stuff myself.

To novels! And to staying up past your bedtime reading them!

Also, trying out this blog thing again :)
