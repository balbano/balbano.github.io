Since finishing school (which is starting to be a distressingly long time ago), I've found it challenging to finish personal art/design projects. Without the structure of school (or of a boss or a client at work), it can be hard to see an idea through the parts where it gets hard. I've been curious if one of the things that has been challenging for me is lacking a creative community within which I could work on my projects.

Last year a few friends and I were talking about boardgame and roleplaying game ideas we had rattling around in our heads and we decided to start meeting up weekly to work on our projects, helping each other playtest, and sharing our progress. This turned out to be hugely helpful for me, and I recently finished my first game! It's a rules-light RPG about wizards.

And a quick shout out to Dodge Greenley, who did the fabulous art. You should hire him for all your illustration/storyboard/writing/funny-cartoon-stuff needs!

I'm thrilled to have finished a project like this and am excited to get to the next one. Even though it was a solo project that I could have done alone, I suspect that if I had gone it alone I wouldn't have done it! Continuing to build my creative community will be a key part of bringing all the ideas buzzing around in my head to life!
