Today's mood: "Wuthering Heights" - Kate Bush

A quick note to make a commitment.

I'm going to do [the 100 day project](https://www.the100dayproject.org/) from April 7 to July 15. According to their website, the project originated [in this design workshop](https://designobserver.com/feature/five-years-of-100-days/24678).

The only thing left to do is commit to a specific action to perform every day. Contenders include: draw a goblin (draw 100 goblins) and, more open-endedly, fill a page with drawings (fill 100 pages with drawings).
